- 👋 Hi, I’m @robid98
- 👀 I’m interested in Full Stack Development with latest technologies and practices.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be a better programmer with focus on Full Stack Developing. In the last period I'm mostly interested in Cloud based applications(preferably AWS).
- 🌱 Tech stack preffered:
    - .NET 6 and higher for backend
    - Angular 12 or higher for frontend. Worked also with Vue on one of my jobs.
    - AWS for deployment. Some of the AWS services that I worked with: EC2, ECS, SQS, SNS, S3, Lambda, RDS, ECR, CloudWatch, Cloudformation, Step Functions
    - For data store I worked with MySQL, DynamoDB, SQL Server
    - For CI/CD I worked with Azure Pipelines
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects. Feel free to contact me, if you need some help on a Open Source Project.
